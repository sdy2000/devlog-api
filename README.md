This is the README file for the "devlog-api" project hosted on GitHub. The project is developed using C#, .NET, .NET Web API, MVC, Email sender, authorization, SQL, MS SQL, and follows a database-first approach.

## Description

The "devlog-api" project is an API-based application designed to serve as a development log or journal. It allows developers to keep track of their daily activities, progress, and any challenges they encounter during the development process. The API provides various endpoints to manage user accounts, log entries, and more.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **C#**: The primary programming language used for the backend development.
- **.NET**: The framework used to build the application.
- **.NET Web API**: To create RESTful APIs that can be consumed by frontend applications or other services.
- **MVC**: This architectural pattern is used for organizing the code and separating concerns within the application.
- **Email Sender**: The application incorporates functionality to send emails, which can be used for various purposes like account verification, password reset, etc.
- **Authorization**: To manage user access and ensure the security of the application.
- **SQL**: The project uses SQL for interacting with the database.
- **MS SQL**: Microsoft SQL Server is employed as the database management system to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- **DB First**: The database-first approach is used to design the database schema first, and then the code is generated from it.
